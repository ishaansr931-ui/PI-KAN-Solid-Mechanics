# Physics-Informed Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks for Solid Mechanics

This repository contains physics-informed Kolmogorov–Arnold Network (KAN)
implementations for benchmark linear elasticity problems, developed during
a research internship at IIT Guwahati.

Problems studied:
- Cantilever beam under pure bending
- Plate with a circular hole under uniaxial tension

The KAN predictions are validated against analytical solutions and
finite element reference results.
